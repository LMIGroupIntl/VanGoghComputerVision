# Copy this code

The code included in this repository can be downloaded and modified, for those users interested in experimenting further in this space.

We used python notebooks in order to facilitate the readability of our code, and rigorously documented our thinking at each step.

The data used to train our models is not ours to share, but where possible, we have provided a uri to that image so that those users interested in working with the same data should be able to reconstruct the datasets easily.

We recommend forking the repository in order to make it easier to suggest changes or stay up to date with any changes we make to our own.
